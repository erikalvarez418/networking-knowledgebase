# Types of Networks

In networking, different types of networks exist based on size, purpose, and geographic scope. Knowing these helps you design, troubleshoot, and secure networks effectively.

## Why It Matters in Real Life

As a technician or network admin, you’ll run into various types of networks:
- **LANs** inside school campuses or offices
- **WANs** connecting multiple sites
- **WLANs** using Wi-Fi in workspaces
- **MANs** in city-wide government or university systems

Understanding the differences helps you choose the right equipment and security models.

## Common Types of Networks

| Type  | Stands For         | Scope                  | Key Features                                  | Real-World Examples                  |
|-------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| LAN   | Local Area Network | Small geographic area  | High speed, private, wired or wireless        | Offices, classrooms, homes           |
| WLAN  | Wireless LAN       | Small area via Wi-Fi   | Same as LAN but wireless                      | Schools, coffee shops, open offices  |
| WAN   | Wide Area Network  | Large geographical area| Uses public or leased lines, slower than LANs | ISPs, multi-site corporations        |
| MAN   | Metropolitan Area Network | City-sized area   | High-speed, fiber-based city-wide networks    | College campuses, government grids   |
| PAN   | Personal Area Network | Very short range     | Centered around a single user/device          | Bluetooth headphones, smartphone sync|

## When Do You Use Each?

- **LAN:** Fast and secure networking inside a single building or campus
- **WLAN:** Great for mobility and guest access
- **WAN:** Needed when you’re linking multiple offices in different cities
- **MAN:** Used by large organizations with infrastructure across a city
- **PAN:** For pairing personal tech like phones and smartwatches

## Technician Tip

> LANs and WLANs are the networks you’ll troubleshoot most often. WANs and MANs usually involve ISPs or third-party vendors.
